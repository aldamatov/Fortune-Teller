/* The Fortune Teller
Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids." */


const numberOfChildren = 3;
const partnerName = "Jika";
const geoLocation = "Sydney";
const jobTitle = "Frontend Developer";

console.log("You will be a "+jobTitle+" in " +geoLocation+", and married to " +partnerName +" with " + numberOfChildren + " kids. ")
